🚀 Coding Assistant - AI-Powered Chrome Extension

Code Smarter, Solve Faster - Your AI-Powered Coding Companion!

📌 About the Project

This project was built during the AlgoZenith Hackathon (3-day event) to help students, competitive programmers, and developers solve coding problems efficiently within time constraints. The extension provides AI-driven guidance to enhance problem-solving skills with structured feedback.

✨ Features

🔹 Understanding the Problem – Get a clear breakdown of the problem statement.
🔹 Finding the Right Approach – Identify the best strategy for solving the problem.
🔹 Refining Your Solution – AI provides suggestions to optimize your code.
🔹 Implementation Feedback – Get AI-generated feedback on improving code structure and efficiency.

🎯 Who Can Use It?
	•	Students learning coding concepts
	•	Competitive programmers preparing for contests
	•	Developers who want AI-assisted problem-solving

⚠️ Quick Review Mode (Feature Availability Timing)

For a fair evaluation of the extension’s structured approach, we have not modified the code to allow instant access to all features. Instead, the options will unlock progressively:

⏳ Feature Unlock Timing:
	•	✅ Problem Explanation – Available after 5 minutes of using the “Code” feature.
	•	✅ Problem Approach – Available after 7 minutes of using the “Code” feature.
	•	✅ Solution Refinement – Available after 10 minutes of using the “Code” feature.
	•	✅ Implementation Feedback – Available after 10 minutes of using the “Solution Refinement” feature.

This ensures step-by-step guidance and prevents skipping directly to solutions, maintaining the extension’s educational intent.
